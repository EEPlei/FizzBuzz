### Implementation

<!--
Use this section to implement the fizzbuzz function.

This should include a short write up describing your appraoch
to implementing the function. Not both code formating / style
and your writeup matter for your overall grade.
-->

```{r}

sequence <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 1)
# will generate a sequence from 1 to 100. 100 numbers total #
FizzBuzz =function(x) {
for (x in 1:100){
    if (x%%15==0) print("FizzBuzz")
    else if (x%%3==0) print("Fizz") 
    else if (x%%5==0) print("Buzz")
    else 
    print(x)
}
}

FizzBuzz(x)


```

### Output

<!--
Use this section to show the output of your 
fizzbuzz function for integer values from 1 to 100.

No writeup is necessary for this section.
