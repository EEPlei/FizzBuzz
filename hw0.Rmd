### Implementation

<!--
Use this section to implement the fizzbuzz function.

This should include a short write up describing your appraoch
to implementing the function. Not both code formating / style
and your writeup matter for your overall grade.
-->

```{r}  Our approach to this problem was to first defend our function 
against results that we don't want. As you can see we have 3 If
Statements detailing that the function should stop if the input is 
not a vector, not an integer, and if its length equals one. 

FizzBuzz = function(n) {
 if(!is.vector(n)){
    stop("Please input a integer or a vector of integers.")
  }
  if(n%%1 !=0){
    stop("Please input a integer or a vector of integers.")
  }
  if(length(n)==1){
    n <- 1:n
  }


for (x in n){
    if (x%%15==0) print("FizzBuzz")
    else if (x%%3==0) print("Fizz") 
    else if (x%%5==0) print("Buzz")
    else 
    print(x)
  }
}


```

### Output

<!--
Use this section to show the output of your 
fizzbuzz function for integer values from 1 to 100.

No writeup is necessary for this section.

```{r}
