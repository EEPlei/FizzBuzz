## Team 4 Duke Dinosaurs

Assignment from STA 523 Statistical Programming with Professor Colin Rundel http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/Sta523_Fa15/hw/hw0.html

## Background

The FizzBuzz test is a common programming interview question used to establish if a candidate can actually program in a language that they claim experience in.
The problem statement is as follows:

> "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each on their own line. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

## Task 1 - Implement FizzBuzz 

Your goal here is to implement the FizzBuzz program as a generalized function in R. Your function should conform to the description provided above  but should accept a single integer argument (which can either be a scalar or vector). As such, your function should correctly output Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the actual number for each integer supplied. You must also include a write up of your implementation that broadly describes how you approached the problem and constructed your solution (think something along the lines of the methods section of a journal article). 

You should program defensively - validate any input and make sure that you have a sane response to any invalid input.

This is not a terribly complex or difficult task, and solutions in R and many other languages are easily Googleable - the point of this exercise is to get use to the workflow and tools we will be using in this class. This includes RStudio, rmarkdown, git, github, Wercker, etc., so use this opportunity to get comfortable with them.


## Task 2 - FizzBuzz(1:100)

Use your FizzBuzz function to display the correct output for an input of all integers from 1 to 100.
